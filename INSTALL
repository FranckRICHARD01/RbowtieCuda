** Additional Installation Instructions **


__________________ Ubuntu 22.04 ________________

It is essential to install the CUDA development suite in order to compile nvBowtie. 
You will find a script in the 'inst' directory to facilitate the installation of 
CUDA on Ubuntu 18.04 or higher. This script installs version 11.8, but it is possible 
to use this package with an older version of CUDA. The default architecture supported 
by nvBowtie is Pascal ('sm_60'), but it is possible to change this parameter by going 
to src/nvbio-1.1.00/CMakefile.txt.
You just need to ensure that the version of the chosen architecture is compatible 
with the version of the CUDA software suite that is installed on your machine 
(https://arnon.dk/matching-sm-architectures-arch-and-gencode-for-various-nvidia-cards). 


_____________________ Windows __________________

** Cuda installation on Windows **

You must have a developer account on the NVidia site (https://developer.nvidia.com).
If you don't have one, you must create one.

Then download the Cuda toolkit 11.8 which you can find here :

https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11-8-0-download-archive?target_os=Windows&target_arch=x86_64

For more details about the installation of Cuda, you can consult this page:
 
https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-microsoft-windows/index.html

** RTools on Windows ** 

On Windows, it is also necessary to install RTools :

https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/

The compilation of the package can be very lengthy on Windows (15 minutes) due to the 
slowness of NVidia's nvcc compiler.
