** Additional Installation Instructions **


__________________ Ubuntu 24.04 and more _________________

To compile nvBowtie, it is essential to install the CUDA development suite. A script is provided
in the 'inst/scripts' directory to facilitate the installation of CUDA on Ubuntu 18.04 or later. This script
installs version 11.8 by default, but older CUDA versions can also be used with this package.

The default architecture supported by nvBowtie is Pascal (sm_60). However, you can modify this parameter
by editing src/nvbio/CMakefile.txt. Ensure that the selected architecture is compatible with the
installed version of the CUDA software suite. Refer to the compatibility guide for NVIDIA cards here:
(https://arnon.dk/matching-sm-architectures-arch-and-gencode-for-various-nvidia-cards). 

It is also necessary to install the thrust and cub libraries by typing in a terminal :
sudo apt install libthrust-dev libcub-dev
