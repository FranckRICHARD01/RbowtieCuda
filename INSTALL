** Additional Installation Instructions **

It is essential to install the CUDA development suite in order to compile nvBowtie. 
You will find a script in the 'inst' directory to facilitate the installation of 
CUDA on Ubuntu 18.04 or higher. This script installs version 11.8, but it is possible 
to use this package with an older version of CUDA. The default architecture supported 
by nvBowtie is Pascal ('sm_60'), but it is possible to change this parameter by going 
to src/nvbio-1.1.00/CMakefile.txt.
You just need to ensure that the version of the chosen architecture is compatible 
with the version of the CUDA software suite that is installed on your machine 
(https://arnon.dk/matching-sm-architectures-arch-and-gencode-for-various-nvidia-cards). 

The compilation of the package can be very lengthy on Windows (15 minutes) due to the 
slowness of NVidia's nvcc compiler.
